## rmoriedata 0.1.1

### New exported helpers — differential privacy + re-identification risk

Six small, base-R-only helpers for analysts releasing aggregate statistics
from the bundled fixtures (or any other dataset) without re-identification
risk:

* `morie_dp_laplace_count()` — (epsilon, 0)-DP count via the Laplace
  mechanism (sensitivity 1).
* `morie_dp_gaussian_mean()` — approximate (epsilon, delta)-DP mean of a
  bounded numeric vector via the analytic Gaussian mechanism.
* `morie_dp_laplace_histogram()` — per-bin Laplace noise on a histogram.
* `morie_k_anonymity_verify()` — checks k-anonymity over a set of
  quasi-identifiers and returns the offending equivalence classes.
* `morie_l_diversity_verify()` — per-class distinct-count check on a
  sensitive attribute.
* `morie_cell_suppress()` — small-cell suppression with optional
  complementary suppression so primary-suppressed cells can't be
  reconstructed from row/column marginals (StatCan-style).

All helpers use only base R + the existing `stats` import; no new
runtime dependencies. Inputs are validated and edge cases (empty
vectors, NAs, out-of-bounds inputs, invalid privacy parameters) throw
informative errors.

### Tests

* `tests/testthat/test-dp.R` — Monte-Carlo convergence + variance-scaling
  sanity tests for the DP mechanisms; input-validation coverage.
* `tests/testthat/test-k-anonymity.R` — hand-built fixtures with known
  equivalence-class structure; complementary-suppression correctness.

## rmoriedata 0.1.0

* Initial public release. Bundled fixtures only; no exported functions.
